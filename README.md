**Key Features:**

* Language: Swift
* UI Framework: UIKit
* Layout: ViewCode for a programmatic and responsive UI design.
* Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller) for a structured and modular codebase.

**Unit Testing:**
Unit tests are implemented using Quick and Nimble frameworks, establishing a dependable testing suite for various components. Nimble Snapshots are utilized for capturing and verifying visual changes, ensuring consistent and expected UI behavior. To ensure successful snapshot tests, they need to be run on an iPhone 15 Pro Max.

**Note:**
The Movie App is still a work in progress. Right now, it's in Portuguese, and we're updating it to make it even better. Stay tuned for more cool features!
